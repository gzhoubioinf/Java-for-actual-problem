//A department store needs an application for tracking sales, calculating sales targets and 
producing reports. Each department submits its monthly sales as shown in Table 1. These 
2 sales are then presented to the company executive board in a quarterly report. Each 
quarter consist of 3 months starting with the first quarter being from January to March 
inclusively.



They require an application to use this data to produce a report for each quarter which 
should include:
1. The total sales for each department per quarter i.e. “2nd Quarter totals: 
Electrical, £208,000”
2. The name of the best and worst preforming department per quarter, with its 
respective monthly sales i.e. “2nd Quarter best: Kitchen, £65, 000, £67,000, 
£56,000” for the second quarter.
3. The most effective month for each department (within a quarter) and its sales for 
that month, i.e. “3rd Quarter: Kitchen, September, £72,000; Electrical, August 
£104,000”
4. Given the total sales for each quarter, calculate the tax that needs to be paid at 
17%.
5. Given the average sales for each department across the last reported quarter, 
provide a new sales target for each department with an increase of 12%
